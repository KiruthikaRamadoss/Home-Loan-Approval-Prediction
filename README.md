## Overview

This project addresses a real-world challenge in automating the loan eligibility process for financial institutions. Using historical data, we built models to assess the likelihood of home loan approval and identify key influencing features like credit history, marital status, and property area.

**Objectives:**
- Analyze factors influencing home loan approval
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Visualize insights and model outcomes

## Dataset

- **Source:** Dream Housing Finance Company dataset
- **Size:** 600+ records
- **Features Include:**
  - Gender, Marital Status, Dependents, Education, Self-Employed

## Data Preprocessing & EDA

- **Missing Values:** Handled 7 columns with missing values; imputed using mean/mode or dropped.
- **Encoding:** Label encoded all categorical columns.
- **EDA Insights:**
  - Higher approval rates for married applicants and those with good credit history.
  - Applicants from semi-urban areas had better approval likelihood.
  - Longer loan terms (e.g., 480 months) had lower approval rates.

## Modeling

- **Train/Test Split:** 80/20
- **Algorithms Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Probit Regression
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Random Forest
  - LightGBM

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for Logistic Regression
  - RFE for feature selection

---

## Results

- **Best Model:** Logistic Regression (after tuning)
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Accuracy:** 86.48%
  - **Precision:** 85%
  - **Recall:** 99%
  - **ROC AUC:** 0.75
- **Top Influential Features:**
  - Credit_History
  - Property_Area
  - Marital_Status

---

## Conclusion

Logistic Regression (with RandomizedSearchCV) was chosen as the best model due to its interpretability and high performance. It accurately predicted loan approvals and highlighted key features impacting decision-making. The project illustrates how ML models can enhance risk assessment in loan approval pipelines.
